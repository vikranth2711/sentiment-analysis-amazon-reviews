# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using **NLP techniques** and **Hugging Face's RoBERTa** model. The analysis includes visualizations, model comparisons, and accuracy evaluations for RoBERTa's sentiment predictions.

## üöÄ Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performed using the **RoBERTa** model.
- **Data Visualization**: Bar charts and sentiment score comparisons.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Accuracy calculated for the RoBERTa sentiment predictions against actual labels.
- **Transformers Integration**: Used Hugging Face's **RoBERTa** for advanced sentiment analysis.

## üìà Results
In this project, we conducted sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon reviews using both **VADER** and **RoBERTa** models to understand the sentiment expressed in the review texts. The key findings include:

1. **VADER Sentiment Scores**:
   - We evaluated the positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores using the **VADER** sentiment analysis tool. The results were visualized in bar charts showing the distribution of sentiment for each star rating.

2. **RoBERTa Sentiment Scores**:
   - Using the **RoBERTa model**, we analyzed the reviews for sentiment and observed the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment across different star ratings. This analysis provided a more refined sentiment score compared to VADER.

3. **Sentiment Distribution by Star Rating**:
   - We created visualizations (bar plots) that show how sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative) correlate with different review star ratings. 
   - We found that:
     - Reviews with **5 stars** tend to have higher **positive** sentiment.
     - Reviews with **1 star** have more **negative** sentiment, as expected.

4. **Comparison between VADER and RoBERTa**:
   - The results from **RoBERTa** were compared with the results from **VADER**, and we found that RoBERTa provided more nuanced sentiment predictions, especially in cases of neutral sentiment.

5. **Accuracy**:
   - We measured the accuracy of both sentiment models by comparing the predicted sentiment scores against the actual ratings from the dataset. The final accuracy scores for **RoBERTa** were found to be higher than those for **VADER**, which is more optimized for shorter texts.

For a deeper understanding of sentiment analysis with these models, you can explore the visualizations and accuracy scores in the project itself.
